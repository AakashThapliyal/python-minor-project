# pythonproject(minor)
My name is Aakash Thapliyal, UID- 24MCC20027, This is my minor project of python whose title is: random password generator.
In today's digital world, ensuring secure authentication is of utmost importance. One of the primary ways to protect data is by using strong and secure passwords. This project involves creating a simple yet effective password generator using Python that generates random passwords based on a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits. The user is prompted to input the desired password length, and the program generates a random password accordingly.
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based tool to generate random and secure passwords, enhancing the security of user accounts by providing unique and unpredictable passwords.
